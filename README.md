## The final product
The final product ended up looking close to the prototype, with some minor changes. It have build with resposivness in mind, though it didnt end up perfectly as i had in mind, but it workes and not completly crap.

## The Content
The app displays six diffrent pizza's, these pizza's are staticly (hard-coded) in the menu service. A service for loading this from a database or other storage could have been made, but it seemed a bit excessive to set that up for this small project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
